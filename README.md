# ctd
a few routines to look at CTD data generated in Sep 2022 

"plt_ctd_sta.py"  makes both a map and set of profiles in gif animation but, as currently coded, requires a few coastline and bathy files

Note: In Jan 2024, I started writing a similar routine to look at MOANA temp profiles and stored it here as well.
